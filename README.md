# minimal-album
_Tiny album script (PHP+JS) to display images in a folder by category_

## Method
index.php includes a short PHP script that scans the /img directory and reads the files into a JS array. Hardcoded categories are sent to a JS function when the respective category button is pressed, and the function displays images containing the category tag in its filename.

## Todo
- Add descriptions, e.g. via csv
- Make categories dynamic
